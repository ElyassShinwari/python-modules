CodeCultivation – Python Modules Collection
Overview

This repository contains 11 Python modules developed as part of the CodeCultivation: Object-Oriented Garden Systems project.
Each module focuses on a specific Python concept, progressing from basic program structure to advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), inheritance, encapsulation, and analytics.

The project simulates a digital garden ecosystem, where plants, gardens, and managers are modeled using clean, structured, and reusable Python code.
